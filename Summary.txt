Dont do math on dates
never mix data types (floating point: single and double) 
move most frequent items to bottom of switch expression when simplifying
using test project to experiment
single and doubles have infinity NaN and dont throw exceptions
check box for integer overflow or underflow
floats are faster / decimal are more precise
combine overloading with generics
use tuples to simplify switch expresions or statements
maxValue + 1 does different things for different types
async has a place in server side code for scalability
use a switch expression for return values
.NET Core apps can be self contained
outside in refactoring with delgates
0b for binary 0x for hex
underscore _ for separators
Ctrl K - D will format your source code
local functions
doubles have a huge range
floating points number will never throw
